# OSFOP-Project-Repo

I don't really know what else to use this readme for at the moment, so I'll just post some simple usage rules and permissions, I guess.

Unless you are a Team Sabreshot developer, DO NOT PULL MASTER OR PERSONAL DEV BRANCHES.

Playtoasters, you have your own branch from which you can pull if you are a Git user and find it to be more convenient to use.

Toaster branch will be identical to designated test releases, and will only be updated when there is a test release to BE tested.

IF YOU'RE A JOKESTER WHO PULLS MASTER OR PERSONAL DEV BUILDS, I WILL SLAP YOU.

IF YOU PULL MASTER OR PERSONAL DEV BUILDS AND UTTER A WORD ABOUT ISSUES OR BUGS FOUND IN THEM, I WILL NOT ONLY SLAP YOU...

### ...I will replace you.

Test designated test builds. They're designated as test builds when they are READY to be tested, and trying to get the jump on it because you want to see and play around with features before everyone else will be grounds for removal from the testing group.

You are not here for early access.

If you think and act otherwise, you will find out quite quickly...

## To not fuck up and download from master branch:

Do this:

`git clone https://github.com/KitaenSilva/OSFOP-Project-Repo && git checkout Toast`

That'll switch to the designated toast branch.

After that, and with every release, just do `git pull` in cmd.

We'll do the rest.

## How does one exactly do this "git pull"? :thinking:

Well, ask us! That we severely punish you and probably will kick you if you do it has no change on the fact that you can ask and possibly reveal that you've been using `master` branch for all this time, nope!
