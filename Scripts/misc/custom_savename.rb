#Custom SaveFile Names
#----------#
#Features: Allows you to set custom save file names that noone will ever see.
#    There are some practical uses! I just don't have any yet.
#
#Usage: Plug and play and customize
#   Things to note... delete/move save files before packing game
#   else those files will go with it! Sillyness.
#
#Customization: Set below, in comments.
